        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
            I was introduced to photography and videography by my brother. He gave me one of his older cameras before hiking down Bernie Falls in Northern California and said,
            "Take a bunch [of photos], you'll find one that you really like after." I wandered through the mossy dirt slope down to meet the rushing river. The sound of the cascading falls echoed throughout the forest
            followed by the white river's rush down towards the lake. As I stepped up towards the rushing water, I picked up my new camera and snapped a few shots before getting soaked by the rain-like mist being
            sprayed from the waterfall crashing into the river.

        <h2>Portraits</h2>
        <p>
            I was fond of portraits. The photographer is able to capture multiple emotions, messages, and simply tell a story with a single click of a shutter. My brother on the otherhand was into landscape
            photography. He loved the thrill of getting away from society and going on intense hikes to capture the perfect shot. We both love the art, we just tell different stories.

        <h2>Videos</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to explore videography/cinematography because whenever I "pictured" the perfect scene/pose in my head, its never still. The vision runs like a movie
            scene and keeps building into different aspects. I wanted to turn my imagination into a reality and videography was the perfect vessel to truly express my visions.

        <h2>Getting Comfortable</h2>
        <p>
            I got more comfortable with my
            camera and I wanted to expand more with my equipment, so i added a drone to my toolkit. I was able to recreate perfect scenes from my imagination.
